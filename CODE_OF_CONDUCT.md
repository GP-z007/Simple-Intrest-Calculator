# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We pledge to keep this project’s community welcoming and harassment‑free for everyone, regardless of personal or technical background. We want contributors to feel respected when reporting issues, submitting code, reviewing changes, or discussing ideas.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that supports a positive environment include:
- Using respectful and inclusive language.
- Offering constructive feedback and accepting it gracefully.
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the project.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Harassment, insults, or personal attacks.
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission.
- Any conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying acceptable behavior and may take appropriate, fair action in response to behavior they consider unsafe or unacceptable. Maintainers have the right to remove or reject comments, commits, code, and other contributions that violate this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within project spaces (issues, pull requests, discussions, code reviews) and also when a member is representing the project in public spaces, such as social media or community events related to this repository.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the maintainers at **[YOUR-CONTACT-EMAIL]**. All reports will be reviewed and handled as promptly and confidentially as possible.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers may use a range of actions depending on the impact of the behavior, including:
- Warning: A private or public warning explaining why the behavior is inappropriate.
- Temporary restrictions: Temporary ban from certain project spaces or activities.
- Permanent restrictions: Permanent ban from project spaces or contributions in severe or repeated cases.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is inspired by the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1. For more information, see the Contributor Covenant homepage at https://www.contributor-covenant.org. [web:55][web:70]
